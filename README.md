# go-roll
go-roll is a dice rolling library written in Go. It will eventually include Roll Tables and possibly some other bits and pieces useful for writing 
code relevant to table top RPGs.

Roll is a successor to go-dice. It's designed to facilitate chaining roll results and currently includes a simple lexxer for rolling simple dice
strings. It supports keeping high/low results as preferred and exploding dice.
